# EmotionalContagion

This is a 100-agent simulation of a hazard-induced panic situation, developed as a proof of concept for a paper I've written during the Spring of 2022, using a minimal 2D engine provided by [Kevin Hoefman](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kevin-Hoefman).

This paper explores modern and seminal approaches to emotional contagion within the context of crowd simulation. It proposes a model which revolves around agents with individual personality traits and memory, acting according to emotions that can be triggered through both hazards and other agents. The model also employs authority figures as one of several reacting conditions, as a mean to achieve a more realistic result - partially aiding the crowd's direction without overruling the agents' willpower.

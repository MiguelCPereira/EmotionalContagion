# EmotionalContagion

This is a 101-agent simulation of a hazard-induced panic situation, developed as a proof of concept for a paper I've written during the Spring of 2022.

This paper explores modern and seminal approaches to emotional contagion within the context of crowd simulation. It proposes a model which revolves around emotions that can be triggered through both hazards and other agents, using authority figures as one of several reacting conditions.
